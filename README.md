# signal-processing
Hi! This repo will have some of my experiments in this field. Some of them may be a part of my coursework while others will be my personal experiments.
I'll put them in seperate folders for easier reference. It should be _"simple"_ (hopefully not too messy)

Please let me know if you found it helpful or feel something could be improved.
